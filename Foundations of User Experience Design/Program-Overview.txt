What I hope to gain out of this course: the technical knowledge and tools to translate my creativity into compassionate UX designs, and make me a well rounded, creative frontend software engineer. 

A Little UX History
UX term was first coined by Don Norman in the 90's, but concept has been around for thousands of years (think feng shuei)

UX: How people use or interact with products 

UXD Portfolio Roadmap:
Course Certificate requires 3 major UXD projects and 3 case studies.

The Basics of UX Design:
UX - how a person/user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product
product - a good, service, or feature

Product needs to be:
Usable - purpose, structure, and design are clear. How would all different types of people use this product.

Equitable - designs are useful and marketable to people with different abilities

Enjoyable - fosters a positive connection between a user and a product. Take user feedback into account through research 

Useful - products solve a problem. 

The point: product designs that take the above 4 points into account improve business, regardless of the industry
