What I hope to gain out of this course: the technical knowledge and tools to translate my creativity into compassionate UX designs, and make me a well rounded, creative frontend software engineer. 

A Little UX History
UX term was first coined by Don Norman in the 90's, but concept has been around for thousands of years (think feng shuei)

UX: How people use or interact with products 

UXD Portfolio Roadmap:
Course Certificate requires 3 major UXD projects and 3 case studies.

The Basics of UX Design:
UX - how a person/user feels about interacting with or experiencing a product
product - a good, service, or feature

Product needs to be:
Usable - purpose, structure, and design are clear. How would all different types of people use this product.

Equitable - designs are useful and marketable to people with different abilities

Enjoyable - fosters a positive connection between a user and a product. Take user feedback into account through research 

Useful - products solve a problem. 

The point: product designs that take the above 4 points into account improve business, regardless of the industry

Empathy is a major part of UX design, because it's important to understand different user perspectives.

UX designer responsibilities:
There are many different kinds of designers

Interaction designers - design the experience of a product and how it functions. How to connect a user's needs with what is actually feasable to build (this specification really resonates with me).

Visual designers - how a product looks. Might design logos, icons, or decide layouts/colors

Motion designers - consider what it feels like when users move through a product, such as thinking about smooth transitions.

Graphic designers - slightly different then UX design, and has to do entirely with the appearence of a product 

UX researchers - research how people use a product through studies/interviews.

UX writers - is the language of the product clear? 

Production designers - bridge between designers and engineers

UX engineers - translate design's intent into a functioning experience

UX PMs - provide logistical support 

Product Development Lifecycle: The process used to take a product from an idea to a reality.

Stages:
Brainstorm - an active discovery stage about generating ideas about the user and the problem to be solved. Research plays a key role in this stage.

Define - Using insights from above stage to narrow the focus. Specific details of the product take shape. Goals, problems to be solved

Above 2 stages are about defining who your users are, what their needs might be, and what the problem is you're solving for. 

Design - actively develop ideas based on insights from the planning stages above. Create storyboards, wireframes, prototypes during this stage

Test - evals of current product design based on user feedback. 

Launch - releasing finish version of a product to the public. Refinements continue based on user feedback.
