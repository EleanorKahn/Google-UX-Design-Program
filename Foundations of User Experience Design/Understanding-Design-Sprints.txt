Intro to Design Sprints
design-springs - a time-bound process with 5 phases, typically spread out over a week (5 days, 1 day/phase). The goal is to solve a critical design challenge through design, prototyping, and testing with users. It can answer critical business questions about a given design.
Requires that the team has already identified the design challenge they want to address.

5 key phases:

Understand
-sets the sprint on the right track, and allows team to fully understand the challenge/problem. 

Ideate
-coming up with ideas and building upon them, and start inviting test users.

Decide
-narrow down of ideas from the ideate phase. Will create blueprint for prototype

Prototype
-making the first instance, which allows people to accurately test your design

Test
-diverse group of people will test your product and provide feedback. Critical insight can be gained about what elements might need revision.

Usefulness: design sprints save time, prioritize the user, and create a path to bring a product to market that includes testing with users. 

To sprint or not to sprint:
a design sprint can be beneficial if:
-there are many potential solutions to the design challenge
-requires people from x-functional teams to weigh in
-if the challenge's scope is sufficiently wide 


Benefits of Design Sprints:
-all about the user (not sure why this is particular to design sprints)
-value every person in the room, because it means the best ideas 
-focus only on the design challenge 
-lower risks of market flop
-versitile, and can happen at any time


Planning a Design Sprint 

User Research - gotta know your audience before you start solving! There are a number of different methods 

Call experts - reach out to folks to help clarify the problem and give the sprint team a better understanding of what to solve for.

Ambiance (?) - are you in a good room? Does it have whiteboards, moveable furniture, etc?

Supplies - markers, sticky notes, snacks 

Establish rules - is it gaget-less? 

Plan introductions - it's important that everyone is comfortable with others on the team. 


The Design Sprint Brief

sprint brief: a doc you'll send to everyone to help them prepare for the sprint. Start with the design challenge (build exciting new features for app in time for relaunch later in the year). Identify key deliverables - what does your team actually want/is able to create? Logistics - where, when, who, and the sprint leader. Add approvers, like execs, stakeholders, etc. Also include list of resources. Next, there will be a project overview (current state of project, roadblocks, early wins, outline plan). Lastly, the schedule. 


The Sprint Retrospective 

It's a collaborative critique of the team's sprint. Helps prevent people from repeating mistakes. Ask - what went well, and what can be improved?
