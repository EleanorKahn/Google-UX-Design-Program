Intro to Design Sprints
design-springs - a time-bound process with 5 phases, typically spread out over a week (5 days, 1 day/phase). The goal is to solve a critical design challenge through design, prototyping, and testing with users. It can answer critical business questions about a given design.

5 key phases:

Understand
-sets the sprint on the right track, and allows team to fully understand the challenge/problem. 

Ideate
-coming up with ideas and building upon them, and start inviting test users.

Decide
-narrow down of ideas from the ideate phase. Will create blueprint for prototype

Prototype
-making the first instance, which allows people to accurately test your design

Test
-diverse group of people will test your product and provide feedback. Critical insight can be gained about what elements might need revision.

Usefulness: design sprints save time, prioritize the user, and create a path to bring a product to market that includes testing with users. 

To sprint or not to sprint:
a design sprint can be beneficial if:
-there are many potential solutions to the design challenge
-requires people from x-functional teams to weigh in
-if the challenge's scope is sufficiently wide
