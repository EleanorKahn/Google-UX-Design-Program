Universal design, Inclusive design, and equity-focused design:

It's very important to consider needs on neurodivergent and differently abled folks.

Universal design - the process of creating one product for the most number of users (one size fits all approach). Obviously this can make products less effective, because the targeted user range is so wide, and ended up excluding a lot of users.

Inclusive design - focuses on making design choices that take into account personal identifiers (race, gender, neuro, ability). Solve for one, extend to many

Accessibility - the design of products, environments, or services to account for those of differing physical or cognitive abilities

Equity-focused design - designed for groups that have been historically left out or marginalized. Equity focuses on fair outcomes, not people receiving the same things. Focus on fairness and accessibility.
