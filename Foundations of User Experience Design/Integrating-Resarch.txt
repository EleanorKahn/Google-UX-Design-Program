Research helps everyone to empathize better with their users. 

Intro to UX Research

UX Research focuses on understanding users through observation and feedback. 

Goal is to prioritize the user and make sure business needs are met.

User Research takes place during, before, and after phase 3 of the product development life cycle, but it is a continuous part of the product development life cycle. 

Research that takes place before phase 3 is often called foundational, or generative research. Answers the questions:
- what should we build?
- what are the user problems?
- how can we solve them?
Goal is to define the problem you would like to design a solution for. Talking to users is critical.

Research that takes place during the design phase (3) is called design research. Answers the questions:
- How should we build it?
You'll want to ask users about their experiences using the prototype. Was it easy/difficult to use. 

Post-Launch research:
- did we succeed? 
- how did users experience the product? 
- how well did we perform against the competition?

Qualities of a UX researcher:
- empathy
- pragmatitism 
- collaboration


Choosing the Right Research Methods:
What's the best way to get the research done?

How do we catagorize methods?
- Who conducts the research?
- What type of data are we collecting?

Primary Research: research that you yourself conduct.

Secondary Research: uses info that someone else has put together. 

Quantitative Reasearch: counting or measuring. Answers questions like 'how many?' or 'how much?'

Qualitative Research: focuses on observations about why and how things happen. Often based on interviews. Answers questions like 'why?' and 'how can we improve?'

Quantitative research gives the 'what,' qualitative gives you the 'why.'

Interviews collect in-depth information. 

Surveys allow us to hear from a larger number of users to get a general perspective. Can be especially useful when you already have an understanding of the users' pain points. 

Usability studies allow us to evaluate a product before it launches, and tests users experience using the prototype. Get a chance to see how end users interact with the new product/feature. This data is then used to improve the product. After launch, this data can be key performance indicators (KPIs), which are critical measures of progress toward an end goal.


Benefits and Drawbacks of different research methods: 

Interviews:
- take time and money
- have a small sample size 
- allow you to get in-depth info
- what users think and why, ask follow up questions, etc.

Secondary research:
- saves time and money
- immediately accessbile 
- can use it to back up primary research
- doesn't allow you to see firsthand interactions with your product 

Surveys:
- larger sample size
- fast
- inexpensive
- feedback is limited, and not in-depth

Usability studies:
- firsthand user interaction
- challenge our assumptions 
- in-depth feedback
- only measure how easy the product is to use
- they are expensive
- cannot be wholly accurate, as a user will use a product differently in a lab vs real life. 


How Biases affect UX Research:

6 types of biases:
- confirmation bias
- false consensus bias 
- primacy bias
- recency bias
- implicit bias 
- sunk cost fallacy 

Bias - favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information. 

Biases can get in the way of good UX design.

Confirmation bias - you look for evidence that proves what you already think is true. Can be overcome by asking open-ended questions, and active listening to your interviewees. A large sample of users can also help prevent confirmation bias. 

False consensus bias - overestimate the number of people who will agree with our design/idea. Can be overcome by identifying and articulating own assumptions and surveying large groups of people.

Recency bias - easiest to remember the last thing you heard in an interview/conversation. Can be overcome by taking detailed notes/recordings for later review. 

Primacy bias - remembering the first participate the most strongly, because it's the most novel. Can be overcome by taking detailed notes/recordings for later review. 

Consistancy is really important for the above 2 types of biases. 

Implicit bias aka unconscious bias - collection of attitudes and stereotypes about certain groups without our conscious knowledge (the "I'm-not-sexist/racist/classist/heteronormative/able-ist" bias). Occurs most often when only certain groups/identity profiles are included in a study. EVERYONE HAS THEM (yes, you too, and also me). Can be overcome by listening to those who point out your own biases (and probably becoming more woke in general), and reflecting on our own behaviors with sincerity. 

Sunk cost fallacy - the deeper into a project, the harder it is to change course without feeling like we've failed or wasted time. It's the "I've-already-spent-so-much-time-doing-this-that-I-have-to-finish-even-if-it's-not-working" fallacy. Can be overcome by breaking a project down into smaller phases with schedule discussion points to decide whether to continue.

More about bias:

Preventing bias in data collection: 
Choose your words carefully, without leading your user, which can cause the user to make a decision based on the way info was presented (aka the framing effect). 
Instead of "Do you like the improved layout etc etc" ask "how do you feel about the layout etc etc?"

Foster independent thinking:
group studies can be negatively affected by the bandwagon effect, so have people write down their feedback before hearing that of others. 

Avoid specific language:
Open ended questions can help avoid confirmation bias, and make your data more accurate. Particularly prevalent in online serveys. 

Consider users' tone and body language:
If you can tell a participant is uncomfortable and you don't know why, ask them! This can help avoid implicit bias. If your users aren't comfortable, they won't share their feedback with you. 

Be aware of your own body language and reactions:
It's important to remain neutral to avoid Social Desirability bias, which is where people will respond based on what they think you want to hear. Can be avoided by assuring participants that negative answers won't hurt anyone's feelings. 

Plan effectively:
Last minute rushes can create availability bias, where certain users are used/screening is rushed because you just need people right now. No matter how rushed you are, important to choose users carefully.

Remain open minded:
treat all info equally to avoid primacy and recency bias.
