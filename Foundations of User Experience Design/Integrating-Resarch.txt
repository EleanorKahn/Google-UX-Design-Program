Research helps everyone to empathize better with their users. 

Intro to UX Research

UX Research focuses on understanding users through observation and feedback. 

Goal is to prioritize the user and make sure business needs are met.

User Research takes place during, before, and after phase 3 of the product development life cycle, but it is a continuous part of the product development life cycle. 

Research that takes place before phase 3 is often called foundational, or generative research. Answers the questions:
- what should we build?
- what are the user problems?
- how can we solve them?
Goal is to define the problem you would like to design a solution for. Talking to users is critical.

Research that takes place during the design phase (3) is called design research. Answers the questions:
- How should we build it?
You'll want to ask users about their experiences using the prototype. Was it easy/difficult to use. 

Post-Launch research:
- did we succeed? 
- how did users experience the product? 
- how well did we perform against the competition?

Qualities of a UX researcher:
- empathy
- pragmatitism 
- collaboration


Choosing the Right Research Methods:
What's the best way to get the research done?

How do we catagorize methods?
- Who conducts the research?
- What type of data are we collecting?

Primary Research: research that you yourself conduct.

Secondary Research: uses info that someone else has put together. 

Quantitative Reasearch: counting or measuring. Answers questions like 'how many?' or 'how much?'

Qualitative Research: focuses on observations about why and how things happen. Often based on interviews. Answers questions like 'why?' and 'how can we improve?'

Quantitative research gives the 'what,' qualitative gives you the 'why.'

Interviews collect in-depth information. 

Surveys allow us to hear from a larger number of users to get a general perspective. Can be especially useful when you already have an understanding of the users' pain points. 

Usability studies allow us to evaluate a product before it launches, and tests users experience using the prototype. Get a chance to see how end users interact with the new product/feature. This data is then used to improve the product. After launch, this data can be key performance indicators (KPIs), which are critical measures of progress toward an end goal.


Benefits and Drawbacks of different research methods: 

Interviews:
- take time and money
- have a small sample size 
- allow you to get in-depth info
- what users think and why, ask follow up questions, etc.

Secondary research:
- saves time and money
- immediately accessbile 
- can use it to back up primary research
- doesn't allow you to see firsthand interactions with your product 

Surveys:
- larger sample size
- fast
- inexpensive
- feedback is limited, and not in-depth

Usability studies:
- firsthand user interaction
- challenge our assumptions 
- in-depth feedback
- only measure how easy the product is to use
- they are expensive
- cannot be wholly accurate, as a user will use a product differently in a lab vs real life.
