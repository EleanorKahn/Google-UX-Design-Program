Research helps everyone to empathize better with their users. 

Intro to UX Research

UX Research focuses on understanding users through observation and feedback. 

Goal is to prioritize the user and make sure business needs are met.

User Research takes place during, before, and after phase 3 of the product development life cycle, but it is a continuous part of the product development life cycle. 

Research that takes place before phase 3 is often called foundational, or generative research. Answers the questions:
- what should we build?
- what are the user problems?
- how can we solve them?
Goal is to define the problem you would like to design a solution for. Talking to users is critical.

Research that takes place during the design phase (3) is called design research. Answers the questions:
- How should we build it?
You'll want to ask users about their experiences using the prototype. Was it easy/difficult to use. 

Post-Launch research:
- did we succeed? 
- how did users experience the product? 
- how well did we perform against the competition?

Qualities of a UX researcher:
- empathy
- pragmatitism 
- collaboration
