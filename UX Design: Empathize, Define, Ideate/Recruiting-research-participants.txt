Recruiting Participants:

This takes time!!

Should always start recruitment by determining the interview goals.
- what do you want to learn from the interviews?
- are there certain user problems you need to empathize with?
- how much information do you need to get a comprehensive data set? 
- what type of user do you want to interview? 


Screener survey - a detail questionaire to determine if participants fit the requirements for a study. 

Representative sample - a subset of a target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group. Should include groups that have been historically under-represented. 

How to search for potential interview participants? 
 - depends on company, type of product, time and budget constraints, and accessibility to target users. 
 - you can also use social media, or professional networking sites like LinkedIn (lol, linkedin is social media 100%).
 - can also use a third party recruiting agency (this does cost money)
 - paid services/service testing websites
 

 Reaching out to participants via email:
 - introduce yourself and the project
 - why do you want them to be involved?
 - logistic details
 - permission
 - how to confirm their participation
