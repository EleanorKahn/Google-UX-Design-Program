Recruiting Participants:

This takes time!!

Should always start recruitment by determining the interview goals.
- what do you want to learn from the interviews?
- are there certain user problems you need to empathize with?
- how much information do you need to get a comprehensive data set? 
- what type of user do you want to interview? 


Screener survey - a detail questionaire to determine if participants fit the requirements for a study. 

Representative sample - a subset of a target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group. Should include groups that have been historically under-represented. 

How to search for potential interview participants? 
 - depends on company, type of product, time and budget constraints, and accessibility to target users. 
 - you can also use social media, or professional networking sites like LinkedIn (lol, linkedin is social media 100%).
 - can also use a third party recruiting agency (this does cost money)
 - paid services/service testing websites
 

 Reaching out to participants via email:
 - introduce yourself and the project
 - why do you want them to be involved?
 - logistic details
 - permission
 - how to confirm their participation 

 Determine Research Goals and questions

 - want to understand processes and emotions than people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve
 - identify common user behaviors
 - want to understand user needs and frustrations

 Keep questions:
 - open ended 
 - keep questions short and simple
 - ask follow-up questions (why? tell me more about that, etc)

 Prepare for user interviews:
 - script interview questions for clarity AND consistancy 
 - make a required supplies list and go through your inventory (this can also be accounts to sites on which interviews are being conducted)
 - become familiar with the additional technology you might be using, and prepare a backup plan if the tech fails
 - research your users
 - of course, practice 


 Interviewing users
 
 Steps:
 - meet the participant (...), and make them feel comfortable
 - briefly review any relevant legal logistics 
 - gather basic, relevant details 
 - remind them that there are no right or wrong answers. 
 - have good interview etiquette 
 - ask open-ended questions
 - take notes (highlight compelling quotes, document observations about participants)
 - wrap up and thank your participants 


 Empathy Maps:

 An empathy map is a chart that explains everything designers have learned about a type of user. Consists of 4 squares - says, does, thinks, feels. EM can refer to a single user, or they can be aggregated empathy maps. AEMs represent a visualizatioj of everything we know about entire user segment. 


 Identifying user pain points:

 Pain points are any UX issue that frustrate the user and block them from getting what they need out of the product. 

 Categories:
 - Financial (like being interrupted by a painpoint)
 - Product issues (think Norman doors)
 - Process (prevent the user from going from point A to point B)
 - Support (can't access important information/customer service)
