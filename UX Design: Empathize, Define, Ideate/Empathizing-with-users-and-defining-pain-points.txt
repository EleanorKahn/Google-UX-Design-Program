Collaboration and feedback on portfolio projects:
This course starts required peer reviews. 

Best practices:
- understand the activity 
- provide descriptive feedback, rather than just telling people what to do
- pick a few things you liked about their work
- pick a few things that could be improved, and how, and why that change is important
- be respectful
- stay open-minded
- remember your users' goal
- keep your own agency (you can disagree with feedback)
